# EC500-Rhett-s-Go-Transportation-App-
Project for EC500: Building Software


This Project will incorporate many different APIs into one iOS app. Our application will receive two adresses close to Boston University campus, and then using
the GoogleMaps API, display the map and retrieve the coordinates. Afterwards we compare what is the best way to travel
between these points depending on the user's preference: price & time. The transportation methods available are Uber, Lyft, BU Shuttle, Public
transportation and walking.
